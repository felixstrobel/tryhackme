## Task 1

<i>Think of a room like a virtual classroom that teaches a security topic. You'll use a mixture of guides and challenges to upskill in different areas of cyber security.</i>

1. Rooms include questions that award you points, use the leaderboards to see where you rank against other fellow hackers.<br>
   `No answer needed.`<br>

## Task 2

<i>Some tasks will have you learning by doing, often through hacking a virtual machine. However, to access these machines you need either OpenVPN or in-browser Linux machine.</i>

1. If you're connecting using OpenVPN, follow the instructions on the [OpenVPN connect page](https://tryhackme.com/connect?o=vpn). If you're using the in-browser Linux machine, deploy your machine.<br>
   `No answer needed.`

## Task 3

<i>Let's try to get you to access your first machine! Deploy the machine attached to this task and wait one minute for it to configure. To deploy click the green `Deploy` button.</i>

1. Go to your machine's website (http://MACHINE_IP) - What is the flag text shown on the machine's webpage?<br>
   `flag{connection_verified}`

## Task 4

<i>Now you've managed to deploy and access a TryHackMe machine. Search for a security topic to learn on the [Hacktivities](https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities) page.</i>

1. Read the above and explore TryHackMe!<br>
   `No answer needed.`
