## Task 2

<i>Some tasks will have you learning by doing, often through hacking a virtual machine. However, to access these machines you need to either: OpenVPN or in-browser Linux machine.</i>

1. If you're connecting using OpenVPN - Follow the instructions on the [OpenVPN connect page](https://tryhackme.com/connect?o=vpn). If you're using the in-browser Kali machine (with all your needed security tools), deploy your machine.<br>

## Task 3

<i>Lets get you accessing your first machine! Deploy the machine attached to this task and wait 1 minute for it to configure. To deploy click the green `Deploy` button.</i>

1. Go to your machines website (http://MACHINE_IP) - What is the flag text shown on the machines webpage?
   `flag{connection_verified}`

## Task 4

<i>Now you've managed to deploy and access a TryHackMe machine, search for a security topic to learn on the [Hacktivities](https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities) page.</i>
